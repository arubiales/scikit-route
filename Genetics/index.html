                <h1 id="genetics">Genetics</h1>
<p>The main advantage of this Genetic algorithm over others solutions are:
* Easy to learn and to use, inspired in Scikit Learn library.
* Amazingly fast, builted in Cpython results with 400 populations and more than 1000 generations are done in less than a half of a second..
* Very well documented.</p>
<p>Genetic Algorithm is a metaheuristic aproach wich mean is not deterministic, this lead that every time you run the result could be different but will be very near of the <strong>global optimum</strong>.</p>
<p>This algorithm is called Genetic because is based in the Darwyn Theory of Evolution and the natural selection. This theory mainly says that <strong>in a population of individuals, the best ones have more probabilities to survive than others.</strong>. This in our problems mean that we have one <strong>initial random route</strong> (individual), from this initialization we create a  list of <strong>random routes</strong> (random population), we are now in the <strong>generation 0</strong>. so the routes (individuals) of this population, as happend in reality, have the probability of mix one routes wich others and create new routes (have children), and this new routes will have mutations and crossover for each pair of routes (parents) (they have genetics modifications). So one time that all routes of the initial list of routes (random population) have pass through this phase (or not it's depend if they have childrens or not), we will finish the generation. when we finish the generation the worst route/s (individuals) will be replaced by the best route/s (this is the natural selection, the worst individuals die.) and will start the next generation with the new routes. And this will be repeated a number <em>X</em> of times (generations).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>p_c</code>: float32, default=0.7</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Between 0 and 1 the probability of crossover. In each generation
at start the algorithm generate two random probabilities these random probabilies are the choosen when crossover will take place. If the random number is 4 that mean that the number in position and the following numbers will be now at start. And the first four numbers will be at the end.
<strong>If this ratio is very low</strong> (for example 0.1) will mean that a few new routes will be introduced (no childs in the population), so the optimization <strong>will take more time, but the algorithm will be more stable</strong>. Instead <strong>if it's too hight</strong> (for example 0.9) will mean that the majority of the population will be changed per generation (new childs) this <strong>will lead to a fast optimization but</strong> will be more inestable so the algorithm <strong>could not converge</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>p_m</code>: float32, default=0.4</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's mutate, random probabilies are choosen when it will take
place. If the random numbers are 2 and 8 for example, the 
numbers located at that index will swap positions.<br />
The same as croosover (<code>p_c</code>) a <strong>higher numbers</strong> (0.9) <strong>will lead to</strong> a lot of variation and a <strong>faster optimization</strong> in the routes (children) <strong>but</strong> also can make that the algorithm <strong>could never converge.</strong>Instead <strong>lower numbers</strong> will lead to a <strong>more stable algorithm but</strong> the alogorithm <strong>will be very slow</strong> to converge.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pop</code>: int32, default=400  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of population (different random solutions), more
population, more probabilities to find different solutions but 
make the algorithm more time expensive. If the number is too
low, the solution will be bad, because the algorithm can't 
iterate over the loss function with the enough amount of data</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>gen</code>: int32 Default=1000</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of generations. More generations make the algorithm
achieve better solution but also make the algorithm take more
time. This can be solved with early_stoping parameter to make
the algorithm stop when is not improving. If the number of
generation is low the algorithm may not converge.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>k</code>: int32, default=3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of individual populations (solutions) that

k (individual) solution is choosen as a parten for this generation.</p>

<p>If it's None, the algorithm will finish when the last generation 
is performed. If it's other unsigned integer (positive integer
number) if the algorithm can't improve the result while X
generations (where x is early_stopping number) the algorithm
will stop.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>max_time_work</code>: float32, default=8</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of ours that a employ can work per day. For example
if it's 8 hours, the algorithm will force that a route have to
finish after the 8 hours have been completed, making the
employeed come back home. it's a time constraint.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code>extra_cost</code>: float32, default=0</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it's 0 anything happend. If it's &gt; 0 in combination with
max_time_work when the max_time_work is reached, extra_cost is
applied. This add a extra cost to the solution each time that
max_time_work is reached. It's like extra pay for the worker 
each time max_time_work is completed (journey).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>people</code> int32, default=1</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The number of people that you use in each route, for example if
you need two truck drivers. that's another contstraint. That
will multiply the time_costs and the extra_cost. Not the travel
cost because it's assumed that both go in the same vehicle.</p>

<p>The <strong>dicts of dicts</strong> time_cost and fuel_cost, are dicts of dicts for performance reason. these dicst could be also represented as diagonal symmetric matrix, columns and index represent the cost of the point. Here an example:</p>
<pre><code>easy_route = {
            1:{
                1:0,
                2:x
                3:y
                },
            2:{
                1:x,
                2:0,
                3:z
                },
            3:{
                1:y,
                2:z,
                3:0
                }
            }

#We can see clearly the matrix with pandas
import pandas as pd

#Visualice the diagonal symmetric matrix
print(pd.DataFrame(easy_route))
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong><br />
<img alt="mini_matrix" src="../images/diagonal_matrix_mini.png" /></p>
<p>It's important to understund that the cost matrix <strong>must be the computation of all the costs</strong> that the user of the algorithm want to take in count <strong>per person</strong>. In the majority of cases the cost will be composed by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of the fuel for one person to go from one point to another.</li>
<li>The cost of the hours of work needed from one point to another.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we have multiple persons doing the same route, the <code>people</code> parameter will multiply the cost by the number of persons and will increase the cost with the <code>extra_cost</code> in case of the <code>max_time_work</code> paremeter will be surpased.</p>
<p>Also note that <code>extra_cost</code> <strong>could be used as a maximun capacity</strong> of a truck for example in the case of material transports problems.</p>
<p>The other dict of dicts <code>time_matrix</code> parameter will be only used by the algorithm to compute the <code>max_time_work</code> and compute the final route of the algorithm with the times that the salesman/truck have finished their journey.</p>
<h2 id="ensemble-genetic">Ensemble Genetic</h2>
<div class="admonition note">

</div>
<p>Ensemble Genetic is a bagging of Genetics models, so you can refer to the documentation above to see how it works. Basically are a <em>X</em> number of Genetics estimator, this will help to get a better result than the Genetic Algorithm, the computationall cost will depend of the number of workers (n_jobs) you use. In the case you use the same <code>n_jobs</code> as <code>n_genetics</code> you will achieve the results in less than a second.</p>
<p>As said above, the algorith is pretty much the same, so here there are only the new hyper parameters.</p>
<h3 id="hyper-parameters_1">Hyper - Parameters.</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>n_genetics</code>: int, default=10 <blockquote>
<p>The number of Genetics algorithm that will be thrown. The more algorithms better result could be achieve, but's will be computationally more expensive (this can be solved/mitigated with the n_jobs parameter)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><code>n_jobs</code>: int, default=1<blockquote>
<p>The number of workers (threads) that will use the algorithm in parallel, by default is one, and must be at least one to the algorithm run. Use this parameter with caution, maybe can collapse the computer if you select a lot jobs. </p>
