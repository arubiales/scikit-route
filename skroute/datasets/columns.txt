Here are the meaning of the different columns.

The columns needed for the algorithms are:

* id_origin: The id where the path start
* id_destinity: the id where the path end
* hours: the time in hours from id_origin to the id_destinity.
    It's only used by the algorithm only to take into acount
    when max_time_work it's completed
* cost: the cost of going from id_origin to the id_destinity.
    This must be a computation of the total cost on complete
    the path by a person taking into account the hours, and 
    the fuel.


The following columns are not neccesary, but will 
help for diferents preprocessings in case you want realize:

* lat_origin: latitude where the path start
* lon_origin: longitude where the path start
* lat_destinity: latitude where the path end
* lon_destinity: longitude where the path end
* origin: The exact address of the id_origin
* destinity: the exact address of the id_destinity
* meters: meters from id_origin to id_destinity
* secs: secs from id_origin to id_destinity
* kilometers: kilometers from id_origin to id_destinity
